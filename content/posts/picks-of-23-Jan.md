### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è¬†The Silent Genius of Khaby Lame by Colin and Samir

[https://youtu.be/71Xz6bYoRGc](https://youtu.be/71Xz6bYoRGc)

Big fan of the creator economy and I constantly think about curation ‚Äî content made from remixing other content ‚Äî specifically.
I even have a [foot](https://www.notion.so/New-Feature-Alert-Download-Videos-Tweets-stitched-together-automatically-8a88dff677864914954f7ba7b2e286bd) [in](https://twitter.com/biodunalfet/status/1449532079587434498?s=20)

[game](https://twitter.com/biodunalfet/status/1401553107121811457?s=20) with my app which tries to do similar for twitter
videos and posts that get re-shared to IG. [Khaby](https://www.tiktok.com/@khaby.lame) is a brilliant young man, and his story is really inspiring. 
I like how Colin and Samir broke down the elements of his content that make it tick. From the fact that his silence 
effectively reduces the barrier of entry for consumers and why that is important (Mr. Beast translated channels emphasise this),
how he has a unique and direct interaction with his consumers where apart from consuming, they often suggest content for him
to remix, how he commercialises his brand with his [joke e-commerce store](https://khabyshop.com/) and more. You should def give this a look if
you like all things creator economy.

### üé§¬†The case for being ordinary - Life Kit on NPR

My friend, Hassan posted this on the group chat. This one made me think about what work, life, play and what the essence of all of that is. Should everything we do contribute to some extraordinary future version of ourselves? Do you need to be good at the things you consider hobbies? What does self-care really mean?

### üì∫¬†Dublin Murders, Archive 81, The Luminaries

For some reason, I spent a lot of time this month watching series (these while working on my sofa, ofc) which is unusual. If you enjoy murder mysteries, horror, time travel or magic and fantasy you‚Äôll enjoy watching some of these movies. Let me know what you think üòâ
